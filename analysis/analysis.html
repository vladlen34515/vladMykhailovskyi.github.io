   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;

   <p>
    A thought-provoking exhibit that showcases a blend and balance to what the user wants to see, this is the future of all tech, this is Apple.
    The company’s website is a breathtaking experience for a first time user and its structured so that the user can go to multiple devices upon one click.
    It's truly a piece of art that navigates with ease. 
    This ease is what the user wants, to have the ability to see a visually captivating display and to have the proximity that a typical website should use.
    That proximity should have a certain amount of white spaces so that the user can follow everything that is in the display. 
    As for each element below the user can see that there are no identical elements.
    If there were it wouldn’t be very visually enticing and cause a bland and boring, look to the page. In a like manner, the site shows a great example of closure.
    Below you can see that each separate element is pulled together to create a structure, but with an open view. 
    This open concept shows that grouping and boundaries are present on the web page. As a conclusion, the user can see clear examples in proximity and the cluster of contrasting elements while viewing a sensational website.

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;

      After an exploration of a website that our team chose 
      <a href="https://www.apple.com/?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_339161233435_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand--slid--apple-e-product-" target="_blank">apple.com</a>,
      I noticed the evident example of design principle such as alignment, which is shown on the attached screenshot from my mobile device.
      As we can observe from the picture all elements in the navigation bar are left-aligned and displayed in a block. 
      This makes the navigation bar easy to follow and visually appealing.
   </p>

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;

   <img src="img/rep1.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
   <img src="img/rep2.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
   <p>
      I think this website is a prime example of repetition. 
      The first thing I notice is the center aligned text briefly describing the product, 
      followed by some form of “learn more” link and often times a “buy” option. 
      There is great use of phantom shapes where they don’t directly have rectangles in each new product listing, 
      but that is the shape it is in. They also do a good job at not completely boring the viewer with the same exact thing each time. 
      They switch up the colors, the type of product, and the type of information. 
      All in all this is a great example of repetition and it really gets the user scrolling!
   </p>

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;

   <p>
    Apple has a very distinct brand that almost everyone can recognize. 
    They utilize the largest known contrast of black and white to their advantage. 
    Their main logo is the apple which is displayed in vivid white on a black background. 
    In this screenshot it is clear how Apple uses a crisp contrast to prompt the users to do what they want and remember who they are as a company.
   </p>

   <h3>Typography &mdash;

   <img src="img/contrast4839.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
   <p>
      Similarly, the typography is distinct to Apple's brand. 
      It is the same font they use on all of their adds and even when utilizing their products. 
      Apple has joined contrast and typography together to showcase their new technological advancements to the users.
